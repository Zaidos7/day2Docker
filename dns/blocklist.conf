# Block by redirecting domains to 0.0.0.0
address=/citycenter.jo/0.0.0.0
#address=/tracker.example.net/0.0.0.0
#address=/malicious.example.org/0.0.0.0

#### Hosts-style (uncomment and use if you want hosts file entries)
# 0.0.0.0 ads.example.com
# 0.0.0.0 tracker.example.net
# 0.0.0.0 malicious.example.org

#### Plain domain list (one domain per line)
# Useful for tools that ingest domain-only lists.
#ads.example.com
#tracker.example.net
#malicious.example.org

#### Allowlist / Exceptions
# If you need to exempt a domain from being blocked, list it here and
# ensure your DNS tool applies allowlists before blocklists.
# For dnsmasq you would typically remove or avoid the `address=` entry.
# Example:
#allow.example.com

#### Notes
# - Replace example domains above with real domains you want to block.
# - Keep this file under version control so you can track additions/removals.
# - If you want automated updates from public blocklists, consider using a
#   small script that converts those lists to the format you need.
